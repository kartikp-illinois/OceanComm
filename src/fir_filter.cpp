//formula:  h[n] = sinc( (B/FS) * (n - (N - 0.5)) ) * (1 + cos( Ï€ * (n - (N - 0.5)) / (N + 0.5) ) )
//as a fourier transform, this is equivalent to a lowpass filter with cutoff frequency B. 
//the cosine window reduces ripples in the frequency response - this is called the windowed-sinc method of designing FIR filters.
//if we did not use the cosine window, the filter would have more ripples in the passband and stopband (Gibbs phenomenon).
// "ripples" are variations in the frequency response that cause some frequencies (especially near the cutoff) to be
        // amplified or attenuated more than others.
//normalizing the filter coefficients would ensure that the sum of the coefficients equals 1.0, which means that
        // the filter does not amplify or attenuate the overall signal level.
        // This is important for preserving the signal's energy and preventing unwanted gain or loss.
        // the energy of the filter is the sum of the squares of its coefficients.
        // it is common practice to normalize the filter coefficients to ensure that the filter has a unity gain at DC (0 Hz).
        // important because it prevents clipping and distortion in audio applications.
        // in radar or sonar applications, it helps maintain the integrity of the received signal.


//this is the constructor for the FIRFilter class. 
//It initializes the delay line with zeros, sets the write index and sample count to zero, 
//and calls the calculateCoefficients() method to compute the filter coefficients.
